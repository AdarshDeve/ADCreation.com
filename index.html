<h1><font color=white>What is Solar System?</font></h1>
<h2><font color=red>A solar system is a star and everything that orbits it, including planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other objects: </font></h2>
<ul>
<h2>
<font color=aqua>
<li style="list-style-type:disc">The sun: The largest object in our solar system, containing 99.8% of its mass. The sun's gravity keeps all the other objects in orbit. 
<li style="list-style-type:disc">Planets: Our solar system has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
<li style="list-style-type:disc">Moons: Moons orbit planets. Jupiter has the most named moons, with 50. Mercury and Venus don't have any moons. 
<li style="list-style-type:disc">Asteroids and comets: There are thousands of asteroids and comets in our solar system.  
<li style="list-style-type:disc">Dwarf planets: There are several dwarf planets in our solar system, including Pluto. 
<li style="list-style-type:disc">Kuiper Belt: A ring of comets located past Neptune. 
<li style="list-style-type:disc">Oort Cloud: A spherical cloud of comets that marks the outer edge of our solar system.

<h2><font color=red>The solar system is located in the Milky Way galaxy, in the Orion Arm. It orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph), taking about 230 million years to complete one orbit.</font></h2>

<h2><font color = aqua>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It’s just a little bigger than Earth’s Moon. Mercury itself, though, doesn’t have any moons. It is the closest planet to the Sun, but it’s actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter.
<p>
Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that is covered with craters. Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking meteoroids. Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. Mercury doesn’t have any moons.

<h1><font color=yellowish>2.Venus</h1>
</ul>
</p>
<center><marquee><img src= "ve.jpg" height="200" width="300"></marquee></center>
<h2><font color = aqua>Even though Venus isn't the closest planet to the Sun, it is still the hottest. It has a thick atmosphere full of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and clouds made of sulfuric acid. The gas traps heat and keeps Venus toasty warm. In fact, it's so hot on Venus, metals like lead would be puddles of melted liquid.
<p>
Venus looks like a very active planet. It has mountains and volcanoes. Venus is similar in size to Earth. Earth is just a little bit bigger.

Venus is unusual because it spins the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets. And its rotation is very slow. It takes about 243 Earth days to spin around just once. Because it's so close to the Sun, a year goes by fast. It takes 225 Earth days for Venus to go all the way around the Sun. That means that a day on Venus is a little longer than a year on Venus.

Since the day and year lengths are similar, one day on Venus is not like a day on Earth. Here, the Sun rises and sets once each day. But on Venus, the Sun rises every 117 Earth days. That means the Sun rises two times during each year on Venus, even though it is still the same day on Venus! And because Venus rotates backwards, the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.

Just like Mercury, Venus doesn't have any moons.

<h2><font color= aqua>Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. It has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean planet. Water covers 70% of Earth's surface.
<p>
Our atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe. The atmosphere also protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in our atmosphere before they can strike the surface as meteorites.

Since we live here, you might think we know all there is to know about Earth. Not at all, actually! We have a lot we can learn about our home planet. Right now, there are many satellites orbiting Earth taking pictures and measurements. This is how we can learn more about weather, oceans, soil, climate change, and many other important topics.

<h1><font color=red>4.Mars</h1>
</ul>
<center><marquee><img src ="download (3).jpeg" height="300" width="300"></marquee></center>
<h2><font color= aqua> Mars is a cold desert world. The average temperature on Mars is minus 85 degrees Fahrenheit – way below freezing. It is half the size of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red because of rusty iron in the ground.
<p>
Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon. People would not be able to breathe the air on Mars.
</P>
<p>
There are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but now water mostly exists in icy dirt and thin clouds. On some Martian hillsides, there is evidence of liquid salty water in the ground.
</p>
<p>
Scientists want to know if Mars may have had living things in the past. They also want to know if Mars could support life now or in the future.

<h1><font color=orange>5.Jupiter</h1>
</ul>
<center><marquee><img src="download (4).jpeg" height="200" width="300"></marquee></center>
<h2><font color=aqua>Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got massive enough to start burning. It is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years. Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface. It is still unclear if deeper down, Jupiter has a central core of solid material or if it may be a thick, super-hot and dense soup. Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well.
</h2>
<ul>
<h1><font color=brown>6. Saturn</h1>
</ul>
<center><marquee><img src="download (5).jpeg" height="200" width="300"></marquee></center>
<h2><font color=aqua>Saturn isn’t the only planet to have rings, but it definitely has the most beautiful ones. The rings we see are made of groups of tiny ringlets that surround Saturn. They’re made of chunks of ice and rock. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly a ball of hydrogen and helium.
<p>
When Galileo Galilei saw Saturn through a telescope in the 1600s, he wasn't sure what he was seeing. At first he thought he was looking at three planets, or a planet with handles. Now we know those "handles" turned out to be the rings of Saturn.

<h1><font color=green>7. Uranus</h1>
</ul>
<center><marquee><img src="download (6).jpeg" height="200" width= "300"></marquee></center>
<h2><font color=aqua>Uranus is made of water, methane, and ammonia fluids above a small rocky center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter and Saturn, but it also has methane. The methane makes Uranus blue.
<p>
Uranus also has faint rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark. The outer rings are brightly colored and easier to see. Like Venus, Uranus rotates in the opposite direction as most other planets. And unlike any other planet, Uranus rotates on its side.

<h1><font color=blue>8. Neptune</h1>
</ul>
<center><marquee><img src="download (7).jpeg" height="200" width= "300"></marquee></center>
<h2><font color =aqua>Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. It's the last of the planets in our solar system. It's more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth is. Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a thick fog of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane gives Neptune the same blue color as Uranus. Neptune has six rings, but they're very hard to see.
